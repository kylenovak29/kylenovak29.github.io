    Mathematical decision making is the use of mathematics to help make better decisions. This article provides a brief introduction to mathematical decision making for the non-mathematician by examining two national security case studies: the U.S. Air Force’s Comprehensive Core Capability Risk Assessment Framework and U.S. Agency for International Development and Dalberg Data Insight’s Outil de Surveillance Épidémiologique Guinéa

    Strum a guitar. Bang a drum. The sound of one is a combination of sine functions and the other a combination of Bessel functions. While every scientist and engineer knows the sine function, not as many are familiar with Bessel functions or the broader class of special functions that frequently arise in mathematical physics. This book provides a guided tour through the important special functions and develops the mathematical tools and intuition for working with them.

   Scientists and engineers often use algorithms without fully knowing what's happening inside them. This blind faith can lead to inefficient solutions and sometimes flat-out wrong ones. This book breaks open the algorithmic black boxes to help you understand how they work and why they can break down. Ideal for first-year graduate students, this book works to build both the intuitive understanding of underlying mathematical theory and useful skills for research. Examples worked out in detail provide a practical guide for using numerical methods in linear algebra, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations.

  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
   We present the results of numerical analysis of normal zone propagation in a stack of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7−x</sub> coated conductors which imitates a pancake coil. Our main purpose is to determine whether the quench protection quality of such coils can be substantially improved by increased contact resistance between the superconducting film and the stabilizer. We show that with increased contact resistance the speed of normal zone propagation increases, the detection of a normal zone inside the coil becomes possible earlier, when the peak temperature inside the normal zone is lower, and stability margins shrink. Thus, increasing contact resistance may become a viable option for improving the prospects of coated conductors for high T<sub>c</sub> magnets applications.

  We present a time-dependent semiclassical transport model for coherent pure-state scattering with quantum barriers. The model is based on a complex-valued Liouville equation, with interface conditions at quantum barriers computed from the steady-state Schrödinger equation. By retaining the phase information at the barrier, this coherent model adequately describes quantum scattering and interference at quantum barriers, with a computational cost comparable to that of classical mechanics. We construct both Eulerian and Lagrangian numerical methods for this model, and validate it using several numerical examples, including multiple quantum barriers.

  We present the results of numerical analysis of a model of normal zone propagation in coated conductors. The main emphasis is on the effects of increased contact resistance between the superconducting film and the stabilizer on the speed of normal zone propagation, the maximum temperature rise inside the normal zone, and the stability margins. We show that with increasing contact resistance the speed of normal zone propagation increases, the maximum temperature inside the normal zone decreases, and stability margins shrink. This may have an overall beneficial effect on quench protection quality of coated conductors. We also briefly discuss the propagation of solitons and development of the temperature modulation along the wire.

  We present a two-dimensional time-dependent semiclassical transport model for mixed state scattering with thin quantum films. The stationary Schrödinger equation is solved in the quantum barrier to obtain the scattering coefficients used to supply the interface condition that connects two classical domains. The solution in the classical regions is solved using a particle method and interface condition combined with the Hamiltonian-preserving scheme. The overall cost is roughly the same as solving a classical barrier. We construct a numerical method based on this semiclassical approach and validate the model using two numerical examples.

  We present a one-dimensional time-dependent semiclassical transport model for mixed state scattering with thin quantum barriers. The idea is to solve a stationary Schrödinger equation in the thin quantum barrier to obtain the scattering coefficients, and then use them to supply the interface condition that connects the two classical domains. We then build in the interface condition to the numerical flux, in the spirit of the Hamiltonian-preserving scheme introduced by Jin and Wen for a classical barrier. The overall cost is roughly the same as solving a classical barrier. We construct a numerical method based on this semiclassical approach and validate the model using various numerical examples.

  We present a time-dependent semiclassical transport model for mixed-state scattering with thin quantum barriers. The idea is to use a multiscale approach as a means of connecting regions for which a classical description of the system dynamics is valid across regions for which the classical description fails, such as when the gradient of the potential is undefined. We do this by first solving a stationary Schrodinger equation in the quantum region to obtain the scattering coefficients. These coefficients allow us to build an interface condition to the particle flux that bridges the quantum region, connecting the two classical regions. Away from the barrier, the problem maybe solved by traditional numerical methods. Therefore, the overall numerical cost is roughly the same as solving a classical barrier. We construct numerical methods based on this semiclassical approach and validate the mode using various numerical examples. In the one-dimensional case, we use a finite-volume methods that extends the Hamiltonian-preserving scheme introduced by Jin and Wen for a classical barrier. In the two-dimensional case, we consider a mesh-free particle method that can be computed efficiently and that may be extended to higher-dimensions. The semiclassical transport model is verified numerically by examining the convergence of the Schrodinger and the von Neumann equations to the semiclassical limit for several examples. Finally, we examine an extension of the model to coherent dynamics necessary for periodic crystalline and mesoscopic scale quantum barriers.
